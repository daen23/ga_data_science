Welcome to GA's Part-Time Data Science Course (v 2.1)! We are building a global community of lifelong learners who are excited about using data to solve real world problems. 

In this 10 week part-time course, students will use Python to explore datasets, build predictive models, and communicate data driven insights. Specifically, students will:

- Learn the language of data scientists to contribute as a part of a greater team.
- Perform exploratory data analysis with powerful programmatic tools, python, and the command line.
- Build and refine basic machine learning models to predict patterns from data sets.
- Communicate data driven insights to a non-technical audience through visual storytelling.
- Become a data ninja.
